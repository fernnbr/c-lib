//The Tests

//Copy bytes where src and dest do not overlap (normal copy)
//Copy bytes where src and dest overlap and dest is after src (backward copy to avoid overwrite)
//Copy bytes where src and dest overlap and dest is before src (forward copy)
//Copy zero bytes (n = 0) â€” should do nothing
//Test with both dest and src NULL (your function returns NULL)
//Confirm buffer contents after copy are correct
//Compare behavior with standard memmove

//The Outputs

//Original buffer:
//Buffer: 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6A 

//After ft_memmove non-overlapping (copy first 5 bytes to pos 10):
//Buffer: 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30 31 32 33 34 35 66 67 68 69 6A 

//After ft_memmove overlapping (dest > src):
//Buffer: 31 32 33 34 35 31 32 33 34 35 31 32 33 34 35 66 67 68 69 6A 

//After ft_memmove overlapping (dest < src):
