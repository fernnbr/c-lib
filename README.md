Welcome, stranger! This document was created with one goal in mind: **to help beginners and students studying software engineering, especially those at 42 School, understand and review each function in the Libft project with clarity and confidence.

The purpose here is entirely educational. This is not a reference manual for production code, but a companion guide to support your **studies only**. Whether you're preparing for exams, reviewing your own code, or trying to grasp the logic behind C standard functions, this documentation is structured to meet you where you are at the beginning of your learning journey.

To make learning easier, each function is broken down into 15 simple and consistent sections, each one focusing on a different learning angle:

This guide is meant to be simple, practical, and 100% beginner-friendly. 
Feel free to use it like a workbook, reference, or flashcard companion during your Libft study sessions.

Keep learning, keep coding and don't panic. 

Structure: 

**01 Function Name:** 
The exact name of the function as defined in the code 

**02 Difficulty Level:**
Subjective estimate of how hard the function is to understand or implement (Easy / Medium / Hard)

**03 Function Purpose:**
A clear, one-sentence description of what the function does

**04 Function Analogy:**
A simple, real-world comparison to help a beginner understand the concept intuitively

**05 Function Prototype:**
The function declaration as it should appear in a header file, showing return type and parameters

**06 Parameters:**
A list describing each input the function takes: name, type, and purpose

**07 Return Value:**
Explanation of what the function returns and what the value represents

**08 Function Code:**
The full C code implementation of the function, written clearly and commented if necessary

**09 Function Use Cases:**
Short code examples that show how the function can be used in practice

**10 Test Main:**
A basic main() function with tests you can compile and run to verify the function works

**11 Gotchas:**
Common mistakes, edge cases, or behavior that could confuse or mislead beginners

**12 Implementation Tips:**
Hints or advice for writing the function correctly and efficiently (e.g., which loop to use, edge handling)

**13 Reusability in Other Libft Functions:**
Whether this function can or should be reused in other parts of Libft

**14 Main Concepts Involved:**
Key programming concepts used in the function (e.g., pointers, loops, memory allocation)

**15 Software Engineering Tips:**
Best practices related to clean code, readability, maintainability, or testing relevant to this function
