## You're Welcome 

In this repo I will centralise the explanations and learnings for each function, including: 

1) How the function originally works according to C manual. How the function is expected to behave
2) What is expected to return 
3) Expected input range 
4) Summary of the behavior of the function
5) List of at least one application examples (text, analogies) 
6) List of what I have to handle to comply with the original function and behave equally (when creating a new function to copy the behavior) in a bulleted list 
7) How to handle possible errors 
8) How to handle the points on 6) applied to function
9) Important notes about the function
10) Suggestion of better / resilient code
