## This Lib

This is my submitted lin with 100% of approval 


## Observations 

- I discovered that some of my functions (resilient ones) were suposed to fail/crash (because the original function fails as well, depending on the input). 

- So I had to change some improvements taht I've made (and are in the "resilient" folder).
