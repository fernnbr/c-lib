## Enjoy 

It's kinda redundant with "explanations repo", but in thsi folder 
I break in lines / in parts the explanation of each line of code 
This helps me to "understand" and extract some pieces of logic 
to use in other contexts or projects 

Explanations repo is more deeper than that, 
where you can have a 360 overview of each function.
