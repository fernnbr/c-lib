These were the first functions that I've designed. It works well and got 100% of approval. Also is ok for Francinette and Norminette. 
However, digging deeper and under test from seniors than me, garbage collections was found. 
Also, I learned that these functions are not protected, in some cases, to NULL inputs or not "allowed" inputs. 
That's why I created the folder "resilient code", whre I made these corrections to submit again. 

Improvements can be suggested under "resilient code folder", this one will keep the memories of the first codes I designed.
